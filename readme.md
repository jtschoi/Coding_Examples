## Description
> This repository contains example codes in Python, Stata, and R that may be relevant in assessing my proficiency in computational and empirical research.

## Contents
### Python code samples
#### a. Large-scale Computing and Local Parallelization
> Contains three `.ipynb` assignment files for the class *Large-scale Computing for the Social Sciences* at the University of Chicago, exemplifying exposure to methods such as PySpark, GPU computing (with `pyopencl`), Slurm batch jobs, as well as those used in conjunction with AWS resources 
#### b. Web-scraping
> Contains two `.py` files that collects URL and within-page information for the UChicago MA thesis research, which uses Selenium to conducting "dynamic" web-scraping and `joblib` for embarrassingly-parallel execution.
#### c. Machine Learning Methods
> Contains a `.ipynb` file that compares different machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning (via cross-validation) to show basic exposure to methods in machine learning. Also contains a `.pdf` version of an `.ipynb` file used in completing an assignment for the class *Applied Econometrics* at the University of Chicago, testing different nonparametric methods.

### Stata code samples
> Contains three `.do` files. `simulation_exercise.do` was written to complete an assignment for the class *Applied Econometrics* at the University of Chicago, testing different estimation methods (fixed effects and instrumental variables). `survival_methods.do` was written to complete another assignment for the class *Econometric Applications* at Princeton University, testing different survival regression methods. Finally, `data_analysis_example.do` is a sample for data cleaning and conducting basic regressions using Stata.

### R code sample
> Contains a `.rmd` file written to complete an assignment for the class *Applied Multivariate Analysis* at the University of Chicago, which contains basic commands for statistical analyses and visualization.
